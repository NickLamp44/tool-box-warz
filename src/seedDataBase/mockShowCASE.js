I looked at what tools I frequently use throughout the season and decided to have those ready to go in the lid, always accessible. That left me with a slew of heavier tools that I don't use as often that went in the bottom. I just laid the tools on top of the foam in an orientation that I liked, got out my trusty X-acto knife, and made a perforated trace around each individual tool. Once I had a rough outline, I put the tool to the side and went deeper with the blade and finally carved out the foam by hand. I did the bottom one day and then the lid the next.",

The western Tolex material (it's what they use on musical instrument amplifiers) is a nod to my youth in Texas and playing bass guitar, and then the G$ letters are just so over the top. Love them! I also have to give a massive shoutout to the @toolboxwars Instagram account. They took a pro mechanic's silly joke and gave some legitimacy to it. The account pushes mechanics to have their best foot forward and I think that translates to the real world. If a rider sees a box that their mechanic built and is proud of it, then they know the same amount of attention to detail and respect will be put into their race bike. Every year, people get more and more creative with their toolboxes and I know I always want to have a good one for a few reasons, the main reason being that it is a great source of pride for me.

Everyone has their own preferences, and it is just finding what works for you in order to have the most enjoyable time out there. The internet is a great source of knowledge and most setup tricks and tips are on it. I would recommend investing in a gold or silver sharpie (dealers' choice on color) and mark where things are. Brake lever angles, shifter distances, which rotor is the front and which is the rear.

              "In the travel between MSA and Snowshoe this year, Trek Factory DH's head mechanic Joe Krejbich and I stopped at Bass Pro Shops in Pennsylvania. We were there for the store open, as were the boys from Intense Factory Racing. That moment just reminded me that we're all just big kids with toys and we know how to have fun together, as well as be professional. It almost seems like a fraternal bond sometimes.",

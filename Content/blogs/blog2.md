Having the right set of tools makes getting the job done much easier and alot of the time safer. In this article, we are going to be taking a close look at Max Morgan's tool box that he carries from race to race. Inside you will find just about everything you need to get through a race weekend, from your standard set of hex keys to hub bearing press tools. Check out which tools are his favorites and which ones he can't go without!

# The Case

![Pedros Master Tool Kit Box](PrivateerToolBox/ProToolBoxCheck_1.webp)

This hard case is a Pedro's Master Tool Kit Box. Pedro's offers their Master Box both empty and as a full kit. I started with an empty boxâ€”that way I could fill the box with exactly the tools I wanted to use.

There are certainly times when the toolbox gets thrown in the back of the truck and gets beaten around on the way to the mountain. I've used this same box for the last three to four years with no problems. It has been all the way around the world multiple times, and so having this bulletproof case from Pedro's has made all the difference keeping my expensive tools inside safe.

## Tools You Cannot Go Without

### Wera Hex Plus Allen Keys

Everyone needs a set of allen keys to work on their bike. No matter if you are working in a professional bike shop, doing regular bike maintenance at home in the garage, or have a travel tool case like this one, you will definitely be using a set of L-shape allen keys.

I choose to use the Wera Hex Plus allen keys because they are made from high quality materials, there Hex Plus design grabs bolt heads nicely without damaging them, and the color coordination makes picking up each size second nature. Over time you just know the orange hex key is a 5mm.

### Wera Torx L-Key Set

Just like the hex L-key set from Wera, I decided to get the same style for Torx as well. This set includes a T8 all the way up to T40. Although not all of these sizes are commonly seen on mountain bikes, I like to keep them in the tool box anyway. They are perfect for installing brake rotor bolts and removing brake bleed port screws.

Topeak SmartGauge D2 Digital Tire Pressure Gauge

I'm someone that checks tire pressure before every ride. The Topeak digital tire pressure gauge gets the same reading every time and is perfect for dialing in your tire pressure for different riding conditions. If you are someone that travels to go ride bikes or if you are getting a ride to the trail head with a buddy, it's a good idea to bring your own tire pressure gauge.

## Some of the Less Obvious Tools

Metal Tape Measurer

Believe it or not, I use this small metal ruler almost as much as any tool in my toolbox. It's perfect for measuring and setting sag, and great for matching exactly where all of your controls are from one side of the handlebars to the other.

Torque Wrench

Carrying a torque wrench in your tool box may seem more obvious than not, but forever I was the rider and mechanic that didn't think I really needed a torque wrench. And yes, you can get away without one and get things close by hand.

Now that I have and use a torque wrench on a regular basis, I wonder what took me so long to get on the program. I carry two different torque wrenches from Park Tool; the Park Tool TW 5.2 and the Park Tool TW 6.2.

## More Essentials

Knipex 86 03 180 7 in Pliers

The Knipex wrench pliers are one of those tools that replaces ten others. These pliers are great because the clamping jaws always close parallel to each other, making it easy to clamp down on square surfaces.

Wera 1/4 Drive Zyklop Speed Ratchet

This Wera 1/4" drive socket wrench has always been one of my favorite tools to use because it makes things go much faster. At a quick glance, the Wera ratchet looks just the same as a conventional ratchet, but with the swivel head feature.

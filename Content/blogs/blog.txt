Inside you will find just about everything you need to get through a race weekend, from your standard set of hex keys to hub bearing press tools. Check out which tools are his favorites and which ones he can't go without!

        text: [
            "This hard case is a Pedro's Master Tool Kit Box. Pedro's offers their Master Box both empty and as a full kit. I started with an empty boxâ€”that way I could fill the box with exactly the tools I wanted to use.",
            "There are certainly times when the toolbox gets thrown in the back of the truck and gets beaten around on the way to the mountain. I've used this same box for the last three to four years with no problems. It has been all the way around the world multiple times, and so having this bulletproof case from Pedro's has made all the difference keeping my expensive tools inside safe."

            "Everyone needs a set of allen keys to work on their bike. No matter if you are working in a professional bike shop, doing regular bike maintenance at home in the garage, or have a travel tool case like this one, you will definitely be using a set of L-shape allen keys.", 

            "I choose to use the Wera Hex Plus allen keys because they are made from high quality materials, there Hex Plus design grabs bolt heads nicely without damaging them, and the color coordination makes picking up each size second nature. Over time you just know the orange hex key is a 5mm."

            "Just like the hex L-key set from Wera, I decided to get the same style for Torx as well. This set includes a T8 all the way up to T40. Although not all of these sizes are commonly seen on mountain bikes, I like to keep them in the tool box anyway. They are perfect for installing brake rotor bolts and removing brake bleed port screws."
